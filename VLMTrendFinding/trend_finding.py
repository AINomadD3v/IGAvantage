# How to use a VLM to watch and anaylzse reels, to find trends and anaylzse accounts

# Have the bot naviagate the explore page.
# It scrolls and takes a screenshot of the page and extracts text. Caption username ect.

# It will identify objects, infer the topic and assess the aesthetic, quality or sentiment.
# Then based off predefined crireria (e.g Keywords, desired topics, visual styles or similarity to desired content)
# We will use this information to then score the posts relevance. (Fine tuning would be very powerful here)
# After enough data, we would be able to spot trends and sytles that are becoming popular
